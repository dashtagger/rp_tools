Event,Description
Remote event,"A remote event can either by implied or directly stated."
NPC action, "An existing non-player character makes a surprise action. These are characters who populate the game world other than the player characters themselves."
Introduce new NPC,"A brand new face is involved in the adventure. This may be someone the player characters had expected to meet, or a surprise. Either way, this new character is important to the overall adventure and will be added to the character list when the scene is over. "
Move toward a thread,"Threads are the goals that player characters are going after. These are the unresolved missions that the players are trying to solve. There could be more than one thread in an adventure, some big and important while others of less consequence. The next chapter will go more into theads. This random event has something to do directly with resolving an open thread. If there are more than one, then randomly determine which thread it is. Other random events from the event focus table can also involve a thread, but not necessarily. This random event is directly related to the thread, and should offer the characters an opportunity to step closer to solving the thread."
Move away from a thread,"This random event will make it harder to resolve the current thread. Perhaps the thread they are trying to resolve is, “Find the escaped criminal.” The characters have been tracking him through a jungle, following a trail of footsteps. Suddenly, this random event comes up, and the players determine that it means the trail has disappeared."
Close a thread,"The random event is so important it actually closes an open thread. If there are multiple threads open, then randomly determine which one it is. To close a thread, the thread is either resolved or the issue goes away."
PC negative,"Something bad happens to a player character. If there is more than one player character then randomly determine who the subject is. The event meaning will help determine what happens although logical ideas should begin springing to mind. These can be major, or minor, events."
PC positive,"Something good happens to a player character. If there is more than one player character then randomly determine who the subject is. The event meaning will help determine what happens although logical ideas should begin springing to mind. These can be major, or minor, events."
Ambigous event,"The random event of “ambiguous event,” however, is meant to encompass everything else that can happen. This is a catchall category for anything that does not directly impact characters or NPCs. The event is not necessarily bad or good. The event can be important, but often it is more atmospheric to the scene. For instance, perhaps a chill wind blows and a few dark clouds can be seen in the sky ... portents of future rain. Or, while examining a house, the characters come across a photograph of several people. Is this a clue or just junk? They don’t know"
NPC Negative,"Something bad happens to a non-player character. If there is more than one NPC then randomly determine who the subject is. The event meaning will help determine what happens although logical ideas should begin springing to mind. These can be major, or minor, events."
NPC Positive,"Something good happens to a non-player character. If there is more than one NPC then randomly determine who the subject is. The event meaning will help determine what happens although logical ideas should begin springing to mind. These can be major, or minor, events."
